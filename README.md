# Sci-Fi Name Generator

## An app that helps writers created names for characters in science fiction stories.

This application is part of a series of apps I created to aid me in my passion for writing and creating stories. The purpose of this app is to remove the pressure of naming characters in stories, by allowing them to create the names one character at a time.

Each button is tied to its own function that picks a random consonant, vowel, or number. In addition, users can add dashes to the particular name they are trying to create. Should the random character not feel right, users can delete that character, or clear the entire name if things are not going well.

The other apps in the series are:

- [Story Idea Generator, Mark 2](https://holgermueller.github.io/SIGMK2/)
- [Alternate Earth Number Generator](https://holgermueller.github.io/aeng/)
